            <h2>My Dream</h2>
            <p>
                I dream of becoming an Android developer in Sweden. This goal fuels my passion for constant
                self-improvement, pushing me to grow with every step I take. Every new skill, every solved challenge
                brings me closer to that vision.

        <section class="who_am_i">
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm just a regular guy from Vladivostok, studying System Programming at Far Eastern Federal University.
                But I’m driven by a bigger ambition—to conquer Android development and push my skills to new heights. I
                don’t have superpowers, a photographic memory, or genius-level intelligence. But what I do is a
                relentless drive—tenacity. That’s my edge, and it’s what keeps me pushing forward, no matter what stands
                in my way.
            </p>

        <section class="tunes_and_tales">
            <h2>My Passions: Tunes and Tales</h2>
            <p>
                Music runs through my veins. I'm all about anything that sounds good—no limits, just pure vibes (except
                metal, not my scene). If I had to pick a favorite, it's gotta be lo-fi. Whether I’m deep into work or
                winding down for the night, those chill, mellow beats set the perfect tone every time.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it doesn’t stop at music—I'm a huge fan of anime too. If you asked me to pick a favorite, I'd say
                anything by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki. His storytelling is unmatched, and no other anime has captured
                my heart quite like his. That said, I’m still exploring the world of anime, and I'm sure there are more
                soul-stirring creations waiting for me. Time will tell!

        <section class="creativity">
            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>
                There’s something magical about bringing ideas to life—creating things that once only existed in my
                dreams. Whether it’s a project or a solution, I thrive on turning imagination into reality.

            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>
                I’m all about staying active. Outdoor workout zones are my playground, where I push myself to new limits
                while enjoying the fresh air.

            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>
                Exploring the beauty of nature is one of my greatest passions. From peaceful forest hikes to challenging
                mountain climbs, I live for the thrill of discovering breathtaking places.

        <section class="veganism">
            <h2>My Dream</h2>

            <p>
                I dream of a world where animals and humans stand as equals, free from exploitation in any form. The
                myths surrounding veganism have built walls of fear and misunderstanding, convincing many that consuming
                animals is the only path to health. But this couldn’t be further from the truth.
            </p>

            <p>I envision a future where cruelty-free choices aren’t rare, but abundant—where plant-based products are
                the norm, not the exception. Yet, in my country, veganism remains in the shadows, depriving people of
                real
                options. Even finding something as simple as plant-based milk is a challenge.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I’m not fully vegan at the moment, I’ve followed a vegan diet for a long time, and it continues to
                shape how I live and think. I’ve embraced vegetarianism, but this is just the beginning. With every step
                I take, I’m moving closer to fully embodying the vegan lifestyle. One day, I will stand there,
                unwavering, as a true vegan—because this is the path I’ve chosen, and nothing will hold me back
            </p>

            <h1>The Path</h1>
            <p>
                I’m still on a journey of self-discovery. My worldview evolves constantly as I explore different
                philosophies and learn more about myself. Buddhism resonates with me deeply, and its teachings shape my
                outlook on life.

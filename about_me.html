                <p>
                    I'm just a regular guy from Vladivostok, studying System Programming at Far Eastern Federal
                    University.
                    But I’m driven by a bigger ambition—to conquer Android development and push my skills to new
                    heights. I
                    don’t have superpowers, a photographic memory, or genius-level intelligence. But what I do is a
                    relentless drive—tenacity. That’s my edge, and it’s what keeps me pushing forward, no matter what
                    stands
                    in my way.

                <p>
                    I dream of becoming an Android developer in Sweden. This goal fuels my passion for constant
                    self-improvement, pushing me to grow with every step I take. Every new skill, every solved challenge
                    brings me closer to that vision.

                <p class="my-passion-one">
                    Music runs through my veins. I'm all about anything that sounds good—no limits, just pure vibes
                    (except
                    metal, not my scene). If I had to pick a favorite, it's gotta be lo-fi. Whether I’m deep into work
                    or
                    winding down for the night, those chill, mellow beats set the perfect tone every time.

                <p class= "my-passion-two">
                    But it doesn’t stop at music—I'm a huge fan of anime too. If you asked me to pick a favorite, I'd
                    say
                    anything by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki. His storytelling is unmatched, and no other anime has
                    captured
                    my heart quite like his. That said, I’m still exploring the world of anime, and I'm sure there are
                    more
                    soul-stirring creations waiting for me. Time will tell!

                <p>
                    There’s something magical about bringing ideas to life—creating things that once only existed in my
                    dreams. Whether it’s a project or a solution, I thrive on turning imagination into reality.

                    I’m all about staying active. Outdoor workout zones are my playground, where I push myself to new

                    while enjoying the fresh air.

                    mountain climbs, I live for the thrill of discovering breathtaking places.

                <h2>Veganism</h2>

                <p class="veganism-one">
                    I dream of a world where animals and humans stand as equals, free from exploitation in any form. The
                    myths surrounding veganism have built walls of fear and misunderstanding, convincing many that
                    consuming
                    animals is the only path to health. But this couldn’t be further from the truth.
                </p>

                <p class="veganism-two">I envision a future where cruelty-free choices aren’t rare, but abundant—where plant-based products
                    are
                    the norm, not the exception. Yet, in my country, veganism remains in the shadows, depriving people
                    of
                    real
                    options. Even finding something as simple as plant-based milk is a challenge.
                </p>

                <p class="veganism-tree">
                    While I’m not fully vegan at the moment, I’ve followed a vegan diet for a long time, and it
                    continues to
                    shape how I live and think. I’ve embraced vegetarianism, but this is just the beginning. With every
                    step
                    I take, I’m moving closer to fully embodying the vegan lifestyle. One day, I will stand there,
                    unwavering, as a true vegan—because this is the path I’ve chosen, and nothing will hold me back

                <p>
                    I’m still on a journey of self-discovery. My worldview evolves constantly as I explore different
                    philosophies and learn more about myself. Buddhism resonates with me deeply, and its teachings shape
                    my
                    outlook on life.
